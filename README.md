# On-Device Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for the assignment titled "On-Device Machine Learning". The goal of this assignment was to explore different methods of building machine learning models that can run directly on devices.

## Methods Used

1. Mediapipe Android Codelab: In this method, we utilized the Mediapipe library to build machine learning models for Android devices. The codelab provided step-by-step instructions on how to use the library and implement various ML tasks.

2. Google's Teachable Machines Platform: We also leveraged Google's Teachable Machines platform to build machine learning models. This platform allows users to train custom models using their own datasets without writing any code.

3. Tensorflow.js Codelab for Text Machine Learning: Another method we explored was using Tensorflow.js for text machine learning in web browsers. The codelab provided a hands-on experience of training and deploying ML models for text classification tasks.

4. Tensorflow Lite and Tensorflow Model Maker for Image Classification on Android: Lastly, we used Tensorflow Lite and Tensorflow Model Maker to build image classification models specifically for Android devices. These tools enabled us to train and deploy models that can run efficiently on mobile devices.
